	Bumped Sinusoidal Warp
	----------------------

	Sinusoidal planar deformation, or the 2D sine warp effect to people 
	like me. The effect has been around for years, and there are
	countless examples on the net. IQ's "Sculpture III" is basically a 
	much more sophisticated, spherical variation.

    This particular version was modified from Fabrice's "Plop 2," which in 
	turn was a simplified version of Fantomas's "Plop." I simply reduced 
	the frequency and iteration count in order to make it less busy.

	I also threw in a texture, added point-lit bump mapping, speckles... 
	and that's pretty much it. As for why a metallic surface would be 
	defying	the laws of physics and moving like this is anyone's guess. :)

	By the way, I have a 3D version, similar to this, that I'll put up at 
	a later date.
